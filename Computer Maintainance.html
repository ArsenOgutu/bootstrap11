<p> Periodical computer maintenance
    The operating system's purpose is to interact with the user. One of his functionality is to anticipate user's
    needs and use various methods to recover in case of  system failure. To achieve this, the operating system
    during his daily functioning, collects and stores important data. He uses different methods for different
    actions. For Browsing it saves all visited web pages. The purpose is, if you want to access them again, they
    will load faster. If major changes take place, like a driver installation, the system creates a system restore
    point. In case you experience issues after this action, you have the option to restore to a previous time. The
    variety of today's programs can create various problems and lets not forget about malicious software which
    were specially created to destabilize your operating system. All these factors put together affect your overall
