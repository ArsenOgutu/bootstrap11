<p>THE Golden wall school was founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation based in California, USA. They built the school from the ground to where it I as a means of showing care and support to education especially in third world countries like Kenya. The school is
    situated at Njoro. One can easily get to the school since it is a fifteen minute drive towards the
    east of St. Andrew’s Turi. The building of the school in Kenya of all the other countries in the
    world had many doubts but it has recently caught the eyes of many.
    The school offers both the 8-4-4 and the i.g.c.s.e curriculum which is highly beneficial since it
    helps students to expand on their knowledge. Though the school is a property of the Bill and
    Melinda Gates foundation, it is currently being headed but the principal who is directly
    accountable to the founders. The students, who usually pass highly in their examinations, are
    exgratia scholarships to both international and local universities such as Yale, Harvard, and the
    University of Nairobi and among others. Having completed their coursework, the school does
    the honors’ of seeking jobs for them. This reduces the rate of unemployment and expatriate
    workers in the country. The school has a current system that involves manual input of data that
    is quite tedious.</p>
