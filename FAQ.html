        HOW CAN I USE MY REMAINING ACCOUNT CREDITS?
        We are in the process of removing the option to pay for your orders by ‘Account Credits’. If you have remaining credits in your account, it will be used to pay for your next checkout. If there are insufficient credits, the system will direct you automatically to pay the balance via Paypal.

    <p>WHY MUST I MAKE PAYMENT IMMEDIATELY AT CHECKOUT?
        Sample ordering is on ‘first-come-first-served’ basis. To ensure that you get your desired samples, it is recommended that you make your payment within 60 minutes of checking out.
    </p>

<p>HOW MANY FREE SAMPLES CAN I REDEEM?
    Due to the limited quantity, each member's account is only entitled to 1 unique free sample. You can check out up to 4 free samples in each checkout.
</p>

<p>WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S BEEN A DELIVERY MISHAP TO MY ORDER? (DAMAGED OR LOST DELIVERY)
    We take such matters very seriously and will look into individual cases thoroughly. Any sample that falls under the below categories should not be thrown away before taking photo proof and emailing the photo of the affected sample and your D.O (Delivery Order) to us at help@samplestore.com (if applicable).
</p>

<p>We regret to inform you that no refunds will be given for orders that fall under the below categories.

    1. In the event of damaged samples received, we will require photo proof of the affected samples and your D.O (Delivery Order) in order for us to investigate and review before a decision is made to re-send the sample to you at no cost, subject to availability. In light of this, any sample that falls into this category should not be thrown away before taking photo proof and emailing the photo to us at help@samplestore.com

    2. In the event of lost mail, we will try to locate the delivery team in Singpost and if there's a clear indication that your order is indeed lost, we'll re-send the order to you at no cost, subject to availability.
